**Alastair Edmonds**

I am a junior full-stack developer, currently studying at Makers Academy & graduating July 2018. 

After 5 years trading equities & derivatives, I started a social finance consultancy – Cortex – to help address major social issues by structuring & implementing impact investments.  For the past 18 months, having studied AutoCAD at night school, I personally designed, demolished & then rebuilt a house in Peckham.  

My ambition now is to forge a career in software design & engineering.  I am looking for opportunities in London to work on interesting projects in effective teams.  I subscribe to ABC values and would be well-suited for XYZ roles.

**Tech Skill Set**: Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, jQuery, Sinatra, HTML, CSS, Node & React [ahem]
